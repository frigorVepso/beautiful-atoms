## What is GullveigarbÃ³k by Vexior?
  
GullveigarbÃ³k by Vexior is a book written by Vexior 218, a Swedish author and artist who is also known for his works on the Thursatru tradition, a form of Norse-inspired occultism that focuses on the worship of the giants or thurses. The book was published in 2010 by Fall of Man Press, a Spanish publisher that specializes in esoteric and occult books.
  
The book is divided into three parts: The first part is a historical and mythological analysis of Gullveig, based on the sources from the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, as well as other scholarly works. The second part is a practical guide to working with Gullveig and her aspects, such as Heidr, AurboÃ°a, AngrboÃ°a, Hyrrokin, and Sinmara. The third part is a collection of rituals, spells, invocations, and sigils related to Gullveig and her kin.
  
The book is written in a poetic and symbolic style, with references to various traditions and currents of thought, such as Qabalah, Gnosticism, Satanism, Typhonian Magick, Chaos Magick, Draconian Magick, and more. The book also contains illustrations by Vexior himself, depicting Gullveig and other entities in a dark and sinister manner.
  
## What makes GullveigarbÃ³k by Vexior unique and controversial?
  
GullveigarbÃ³k by Vexior is not a conventional book on Norse mythology or paganism. It is a book that challenges the mainstream interpretations of Gullveig and her role in the Norse cosmology. It presents Gullveig as an anti-cosmic force that opposes the order and harmony of the gods and seeks to unleash the chaos and darkness of the primordial void. It also portrays Gullveig as a goddess of witchcraft, sorcery, necromancy, vampirism, shapeshifting, and sexual magic.
  
The book is controversial because it goes against the common views of Gullveig as a victim of the gods' violence or as a symbol of greed and corruption. It also goes against the common views of Norse paganism as a nature-based or folkish religion that celebrates life and fertility. Instead, it offers a dark and sinister perspective on Norse spirituality that embraces death, destruction, and liberation from the cosmic prison.
  
The book is also controversial because it advocates for a radical form of spirituality that does not follow any moral or ethical codes or any social or cultural norms. It encourages the reader to follow their own will and intuition, to explore their own shadow and darkness, and to seek their own gnosis and enlightenment through personal experience and experimentation. It does not shy away from topics such as blood sacrifice, sexual abuse, cannibalism, suicide, murder, or blasphemy.
